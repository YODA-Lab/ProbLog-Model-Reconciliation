# Cost Estimation

This folder contains the materials, data, and code used for cost estimation experiments, as described in **Section 6.1** of the paper.

## Included Files

- `Probabilistic_XAI_Final.pdf`: Contains the design documentation and materials used in the human-user study.
  
- `Data.xlsx`: Contains all collected data from participants. All data has been anonymized and is used to compute the preference structure among feature modifications.

- `Bradley_Terry.py`: A Python script that uses the Bradley-Terry model to analyze the pairwise preference data from the human-user study. It outputs the estimated cost scores for different feature modifications based on participant responses.
